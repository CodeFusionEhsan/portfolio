## Available Scripts

Here's a list of the available scripts defined in `package.json`:

*   `dev`: Runs the development server.
*   `build`: Builds the application for production.
*   `serve`: Serves the production build locally.
*   `lint`: Runs ESLint to check for code quality issues.
*   `format`: Runs Prettier to format the code.
*   `preview`: Locally previews the production build.

> Modify this list according to the scripts defined in your `package.json`.  Include descriptions of any custom scripts.

## Linting and Code Formatting

This template includes ESLint and Prettier for maintaining code quality and consistency.

### ESLint

ESLint is configured to identify and report on problematic patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code.

> Add/modify ESLint configuration details here, if needed.

### Prettier

Prettier is used to automatically format your code, ensuring a consistent style across the project.

> Add/modify Prettier configuration details here, if needed.

### Configuration

ESLint and Prettier configurations are located in `.eslintrc.cjs` and `.prettierrc.cjs` files respectively.  You can customize these files to suit your specific coding style preferences. To automatically format code and fix linting errors, you can add the following scripts to your `package.json`:

*   **[@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md)**: Uses Babel for Fast Refresh.
*   **[@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc)**: Uses SWC for Fast Refresh (an alternative to Babel).

> Add details about any other vite plugins
